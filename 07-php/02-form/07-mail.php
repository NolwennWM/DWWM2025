/* 
    Coding a secure and error-free email sending system in PHP is very complex.
    That’s why most people use a library such as "PHPMailer".
    To install it, we’ll need the package manager "composer", which itself requires a PHP installation.

    To install PHPMailer, use the command:
        * composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
